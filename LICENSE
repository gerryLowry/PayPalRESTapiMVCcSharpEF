DISCLAIMER #1
Paradigm Mentors' videos, notes, and source code are provided without any assumed liability.

Amateur and professional programmers are 100% responsible
for how they apply our training content to their own projects.

Amateur or professional, you need to test thoroughly to avoid unpleasant and unexpected surprises.

DISCLAIMER #2

Paradigm Mentors often recommends products from many sources;
we attempt to keep up to date, however, in the internet/computer world,
change is accelerating towards light speed; it is your responsibility
to use caution in your technology choices;
for example, if you're old enough, you may recall "Microsoft Bob",
the "Click of Death", et cetera.   

SOURCE CODE:

For ALL videos, both FREE and PAID, if there is corresponding source code,
the corresponding source code is available at no charge to anyone.
 (registration for SOURCE CODE via Paradigm Mentors optional)

Most Paradigm Mentors source code will be available as code signed,
self-extracting compressed executable files at our sibling website paradigmmentors.NET.

Some source code will be placed on GitHub;
Paradigm Mentors has no business relationship with GitHub.
