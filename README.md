     Brief: Entity Framework allows programmers to map POCO classes to SQL Server databases 
     Details:
     Entity Framework is an ORM (object relational mapper) that
     allows developers to work with POCO classes
     while EF takes care of mapping those classes to a SQL Server database.
     Code First allows the programmer to start with c# classes
     before the database even exists; thus the programmer thinks in terms
     of objects which is a more natural approach to problem solving
     than thinking in terms of database tables.
